###Bug reports
Please send any bug reports using [GitHub](https://github.com/pcingola/bds/issues)

**Important:** Try `bds` latest version. `bds` is updated often, may be the bug has already been corrected.

**Note:** A bug report should include at least

-  An explanation of the bug condition
-  bds version and sub-version numbers you are using
-  A minimal bug-demonstrating test case (i.e. a <code>bds</code> source file that clearly shows the bug condition).

**IMPORTANT:** The example should be <i>minimal</i> and <i>self contained</i>.
This means that:

-  There should be only a few lines of code specifically showing the problem (please do not send hundreds of lines of code or your complete pipeline).
-  No additional packages should be required to run your example (e.g. I should not need to install programs on my computer to run your example).
-  No additional data should be required to run your example (e.g. I should not need you to send me 10TB data files to run the script).
-  Full command line used to run the script
-  Additional conditions for the bug to occur (e.g. additional config lines)

###Asking for help
You can ask question to the [<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/bds-users">bds user's group</a>

A few guidelines when asking for help:

-  **Read the documentation first.** Please make sure you've read the documentation before asking fo help. I know this is obvious, but ...
-  **Be polite.** Again, it may be obvious, but ...
-  **If I don't get back to you...** Do remind me if I don't get back to you within a few days. Sometimes I'm swamped with work or just out of town, a polite reminder helps.
